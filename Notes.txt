    -Notes-
This file should be a place to compile things I've learned in a readable way outside of the programs, and also to make any plans or etc.

- Start keeping the assembly code of each chapter or something, as example code, remember to change nasm command to take the asm file we're working on 
and assemble it to boot_sect.bin

- This file could be changed to a README.md, for better readability and visibilty on GitHub, or could be separated out into multiple markdowns, for instructions like below and thoughts like above, 
 and for keeping learnings in one place

- Could make a clearScreen function in 32 bit mode to make the 'landed in 32 bit mode' string more obvious, 
would be a good way to get back into the swing of it
